# Topos

Topos is a learn-by-doing compiler project. This aims is to create a sustainable functional programming language to make programming more fun and more control, in a higher-level language manner.

### What I am doing now
* writing a frontend in Rust
* writing a incremental parsing at the moment is not realistic
- ~~coercing the tokeniser::Token and rowan's SyntaxKind~~
- ~~parsing atomic values from tokeniser's result~~
- [ ] parsing syntax rules
    - [ ] `let..in`
    - [ ] record, enum, function
    - [ ] indentation validation
- [ ] language server that allow user to input source code interactively
