## What is the Topos name comes from?
Topos comes from the Greek that refers to a method for developing arguments, and now we refer it to the category that behaves like the presheaf sets on topological spaces.

Personally I prefer the first one as it is more understanable. And yes, a programming language helps us to develope arguments in some certain extent.

> extend more on proofs as code


## What do I hope to accomplish?
Programming languages solve problems! Programming languages tell computer how to work with data and inputs.

In topos I wished to make writing proofs easily, by building patterns and constructs on rigid theory.

I hope this can also empower more and more programmers to keep an eye on the program safety, and even more, the mathematical foundations.

To accomplish this, the programming language we make shall allow newcomers to learn mathematical thinking gradually and reduce the costs of writing safe programs in real world.
